# The REPL

Now you've downloaded your Common Lisp. You're ready to get started in your coding adventure! So, on the command line (or your shell, whichever
it happens to be), type in:

```
sbcl
```
and you should be greeted by:

*(applogies to all Greek speakers, yes my computer's name is a bit rude!
In case you're wondering, the terminal is Termux and the Window Manager is StumpWm)*

This is what's known as the **REPL**.  The Repl is an acronym that stands for **R**ead, **E**valuate, **P**rint and **L**oop, because that's exactly what it 
does, it reads your input, evaluates it (checks it for errors, makes sure everything's ok), prints whatever your asking for to the screen, unless you
tell it otherwise, then does it all over again. Some people call it the language shell, however, it a bit more versatile than that, even if it doesn't
seem so at first! The REPL's primary purpose is to check the code you're writing, but it can also be called to run Common Lisp scripts and I'll show
you that in just a moment. SBCL's REPL also has a debugger built in as well.
