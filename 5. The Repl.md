# The REPL

Now you've downloaded your Common Lisp. You're ready to get started in your coding adventure! So, on the command line (or your shell, whichever
it happens to be), type in:

```
sbcl
```
and you should be greeted by:

*(applogies to all Greek speakers, yes my computer's name is a bit rude!
In case you're wondering, the terminal is Termux and the Window Manager is StumpWm)*

This is what's known as the **REPL**.  The Repl is an acronym that stands for **R**ead, **E**valuate, **P**rint and **L**oop, because that's exactly what it 
does, it reads your input, evaluates it (checks it for errors, makes sure everything's ok), prints whatever your asking for to the screen, unless you
tell it otherwise, then does it all over again. Some people call it the language shell, however, it a bit more versatile than that, even if it doesn't
seem so at first! The REPL's primary purpose is to check the code you're writing, but it can also be called to run Common Lisp scripts and I'll show
you that in just a moment. SBCL's REPL also has a debugger built in as well.

## First Steps

Even though you've read the documentation from the website for your Common Lisp implementation, you still want to verify within the REPL which version of Common Lisp
this REPL support, as there are at least three versions, one of which is the ANSI STANDARD. Simply type this into the REPL and hit enter:

```
(let ((dialects '()))
               (dolist (d '(:ansi-cl :cltl2 :cltl1))
                 (when (member d *features*) (push d dialects)))
               dialects)
```
This set of code tests the type of dialect your Common Lisp is using, and it's looking for one of three responses:

**Ansi-cl**  - This is the one you want as it will be the most portable version

**CLTL1** "Common Lisp, the Language, Edition 1" - This is one of the first books about Common Lisp published. This was published in 1984 so it wouldn't be conform to
           the ANSI Standard.
           
**CLTL2** "Common Lisp, the Language, Edition 2" - This is the second edition of "Common Lisp, The Language". This was published in 1990, so it too wouldn't conform to 
           the ANSI Standard.
           
If all works well,  you'll see:
