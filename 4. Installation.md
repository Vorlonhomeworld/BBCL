## Installation Time

OK, so you've decided on **SBCL**, good stuff!  **(\* Note:** If you decided on a different implementation of Common Lisp, feel free to skip
this chapter as it described installation for SBCL and won't be of much help with other versions of Common Lisp).

So, head over to [SBCL's website](https://www.sbcl.org), click on the [download link](https://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html) and locate your
operating system and **correct architecture** (32-bit, 64-bit, which processor..etc...) and click on the correct link. The next few
lines are going to assume Linux is being used (as that's what I use). Version 2.0.9 is the newest version for linux, so I'd click on that link. 
Once it's finished downloading, go ahead and un-pack it (make sure you call it by the correct name, this example assumes the newest 
Linux verison which is 2.0.9!):

```
bzip2 -cd sbcl-2.0.9-x86-linux-binary.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
```

You can then install SBCL to the /usr/local directory in your Linux installation by entering the following command:

```
cd sbcl-2.0.9-x86-linux
sh install.sh
```

If you want SBCL to be installed in a directory **other** than /usr/local, you'll need to enter a different command:

```
INSTALL_ROOT=/my/sbcl/prefix sh install.sh
```

If you've installed SBCL to the /usr/local directory, you can run Common Lisp!  However, if you ran the **INSTALL_ROOT** command, you need
to do one more thing, you need to let the system know where the ***SBCL_HOME*** variable path actually is (where SBCL is installed), you 
can do that with this set of **two** commands:

```
export SBCL_HOME=/my/sbcl/prefix/lib/sbcl # for bash / zsh
setenv SBCL_HOME /my/sbcl/prefix/lib/sbcl # for csh / tcsh
```

That's literally it!  You now have the Common Lisp environment on your computer. Now let's start it up....
