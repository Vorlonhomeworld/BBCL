## Installation Time

OK, so you've decided on **SBCL**, good stuff!  **/(* Note:** If you decided on a different implementation of Common Lisp, feel free to skip
this chapter as it described installation for SBCL and won't be of much help with other versions of Common Lisp).

So, head over to [SBCL's website](https://www.sbcl.org), click on the [download link](https://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html) and locate your
operating system and **correct architecture** (32-bit, 64-bit, which processor..etc...) and click on the correct link. The next few
lines are going to assume Linux is being used (as that's what I use). Version 2.0.9 is the newest version for linux, so I'd click on that link. 
Once it's finished downloading, go ahead and un-pack it (make sure you call it by the correct name, this example assumes the newest 
Linux verison which is 2.0.9!):

'''
bzip2 -cd sbcl-2.0.9-x86-linux-binary.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
'''
