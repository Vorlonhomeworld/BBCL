# Introduction


   I became interested in Common Lisp when I started using **StumpWM** as my window manager. Prior to that,I'd heard it mentioned, 
even toyed with a version of it in Emacs, but I never gave it too much though. I just thought of it as an archaic language that only geeks used *(which is midly 
ironic since I've been a Linux and Emacs users for years, so I'd qualify as a geek for sure!)*  Once I started using StumpWM, and started learning what 
Common Lisp was capable of, I was impressed, to say the least! 

   I went online to see what books were available to teach me this language, and although there are some, none really taught me the way I wanted to learn, so I dropped
the books and started teaching myself bit by bit and started collecting bits and pieces here and there. I began to realize that I should record what I learned so that
anyone else like me could learn by doing, just as I am.  Even though I'm no genius at Common Lisp, I decided to put this free book online.  Essentially, this book is for 
anyone that wants to learn Lisp.  

It's best for beginners because I assume absolutely nothing and explain everything to the best of my ability.  You don't need to have any Common Lisp software at all,
you don't need to know what a *REPL* is at all (I'll explain that, I promise), just this book is all you'll need to start. I'll walk you through the rest, I promise!

You're free to download it, clone it, make updates to it. Pretty much anything you'd like.  Feel free and learn!
