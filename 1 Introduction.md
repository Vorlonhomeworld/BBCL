# Introduction


   I became interested in Common Lisp when I started using **StumpWM** as my window manager. Prior to that,I'd heard it mentioned, 
even toyed with a version of it in Emacs, but I never gave it too much though. I just thought of it as an archaic language that only geeks used *(which is midly 
ironic since I've been a Linux and Emacs users for years, so I'd qualify as a geek for sure!)*  Once I started using StumpWM, and started learning what 
Common Lisp was capable of, I was impressed, to say the least! 

   I went online to see what books were available to teach me this language, and although there are some, none really taught me the way I wanted to learn. I 
wanted simple explanations with clear examples. I wanted to see examples of web programming, modular (or what they sometimes call "object oriented" pogramming)
programming, even graphics programming. I wanted the code to be together so that I could check what I was writing against what was being taught so that I could
see that I was putting the code together correcly. Some books has some of the things I wanted, but not all, some were reference books, not really suitable for
beginners. In short, I didn't really find **"the book"** I was looking for. So I dropped the books and started teaching myself bit by bit and started collecting
bits and pieces here and there. I began to realize that I should record what I learned so that anyone else like me could learn by doing, just as I am.  Even
though I'm no genius at Common Lisp, I decided to put this free book online. Essentially, this book is for anyone that wants to learn Common Lisp.  

It's best for beginners because I assume absolutely nothing and explain everything to the best of my ability.  You don't need to have any Common Lisp software at
all, you don't need to know what a *REPL* is at all (I'll explain that, I promise), just this book is all you'll need to start. I'll walk you through the rest, I
promise!

You're free to download it, clone it, make updates to it. Pretty much anything you'd like.  Feel free and learn!
