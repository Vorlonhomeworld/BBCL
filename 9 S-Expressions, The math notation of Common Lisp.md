# So what *is* an S-Expression?

S-Expressions (or Symbolic Expressions) owe their existence to the work of Polish Mathematician, [Jan Łukasiewicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation) who
first considered this as a simpler way to do math, back in 1924. He would later write about it in a paper called *Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction"* 
on page 180. His idea was to place the operators *before* their operands (rather than write 3+4, he suggested writing this equation as + 3 4). This type of math would 
become known as **PN" or Polish Notation** , **NPN or Normal Polish Notation"**, **Łukasiewicz notation, Warsaw notation, Polish prefix notation** or just
**Prefix Notation**
