## Hello Lisp, Part II

In the last chapter, we wrote our first program. As I believe repetition is essential to learning, we're going to continue with format t statements, only
we're going to add a bit more to them. The format statement actually has [a lot of prefix parameters avaiable](https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/articles/common-lisp-format-reference/clhs-summary/#subsections-summary-table)
for your usage. Don't worry, we won't go through all of them in this chapter, just a few!
