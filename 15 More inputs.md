Now, we're going to combine a few things that we've looked at to write a *very* simple adventure game. It has three rooms, no inventory, no hostile creatures, just
you on a cave crawl. Before I show the code, I want you to realize, this *isn't* the most compact way to write this code, but it will be the easiest to understand. We'll
come back and make this code more compact, and thus easier to code a bit later on.
