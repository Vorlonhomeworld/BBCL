# One sidenote about Inputs

Right now, our code's running and even taking inputs. It looks great so far, right? It **is** actually great, *but* we do have to cover something when it comes to user
inputs in programs. The programs work great if the users enter what they're supposed to, but what happens if the user is careless and enters something
like "bond,james bond"?
